## Cover
I am writing to express my interest in a mobile development leadership role. As a seasoned Principal Engineer with a decade of experience architecting and guiding scalable, high-performance mobile solutions, I believe I would bring deep technical expertise and collaborative problem-solving to your team.

Over the years, I’ve sharpened my craft across AgriTech, FinTech, and E-commerce sectors, delivering impactful Android applications through Clean Architecture, MVVM, Jetpack Compose, Kotlin, and robust testing patterns. In my current role at DeHaat:

I’ve led key architectural decisions and Android features using a 100% Kotlin codebase

Worked closely across teams to improve delivery timelines by 20%

Built CI/CD pipelines that reduce regression time by 40%

Mentored seven junior engineers and established strong coding standards and best practices

At Mydesq, I architected a greenfield FinTech app from scratch and boosted performance while lowering ANR occurrences. Earlier at Nagarro and Webkul, I collaborated across geographies and led teams, building core features, POS systems, offline modes, and e-commerce mobile platforms.

Beyond core development, I bring hands-on capability in CI/CD (GitHub Actions, App Center, Azure DevOps), Firebase, Retrofit, Room, Agile workflows, and strategic leadership. I’m energized by opportunities to contribute at all levels, technical design, mentorship, process improvement, and shipping exceptional software.

I’m eager to explore how my experience in Android excellence and mobile innovation could align with your team’s goals. Thank you for considering my candidacy, I’d be glad to discuss further.
